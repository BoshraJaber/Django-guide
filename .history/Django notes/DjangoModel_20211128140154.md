# Django Model
* [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)

## Create a superuser:
* run `python manage.py createsuperuser` then add the required fields.
*  Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin]( http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) and sign in to access the admin panel
* Groups and Users are default from Django
* Groups has permissions for CRUD to the database.

## Create the model:
* define each table as a class and columns as properties to this class
* More details in the documentation.
* in the app folder -> models.py:
```
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

class TableName(models.Model):
   column1 = models.TextField()
   column2 = models.CharField(max_length=255)
   fk = models.ForeignKey(get_user_model(),on_delete=models.CASCADE)
     
```
  

## Register the model to the admin panel:
* in app folder -> admin.py:
  ```
  from django.contrib import admin
  from .models import modelName

  admin.site.register(modelName)
  ```
* After that, we need to migrate the new database so that django is aware of it
* `python manage.py makemigrations` this command will look at all models in all the application 
* to specify a certain application: `python manage.py makemigrations app_name`
* To apply the changes: `python manage.py migrate`
* 


## Create the template for the model:
* in templates folder -> create the html files
* create a base.html to avoid repetition.
* To extend from base.html:
```
{%extends 'base.html' %}
{%block blockName%}

{%endblock blockName%}
```
