     {{form.as_p}} # this will create each input from the table
   <input type="submit">
   {%endblock content%}
   ```
2. Building the view:
   in app folder -> views.py:
   ```
   class CreateView(CreateView):
     model = modelName
     template_name = 'create.html'
     fields = ['subject', 'body', 'author'] // what I need in the form
   ```

3. Adding the URL:
   In app folder -> urls.py:
    ```
    urlpatterns =[
        path(''create/, CreateView.as_view(), name='create)
    ]
    ```
